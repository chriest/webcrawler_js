# webcrawler_js
A web crawler for getting SEO reports for internal linking of a given website.

Tools used:
 - Node
 - Jest ( for testing )
 - JSDOM
 ------- WIP -------
 - D3.js ( for giving a visual feedback )
 - Docker ( deployment )

This, for now, is a really simple Web Crawler I made just as a proof of concept for me to consolidate HTTP handling and for future others to automate tedious source digging. I want to expand it to be a decent tool, with graphing, a better error checking and testing regime, CSV exports, concurrency, external ref count too, all this stuff. 

At that point I'll also do a decent readme for anyone that needs assistance to clone this stuff if interested, for now though I STRONGLY advise you to look for something better. It's only a smidge more than just an exercise and should not be used in any serious workflow.

Based on @wagslane's Web Crawler semi-guided project
